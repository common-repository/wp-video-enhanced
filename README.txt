Extending Native WordPress Player with New Features. Logo & Branding, GDPR Consent, HLS, M(PEG)-DASH, Live Streaming, Configure Initial Volume and lot more.

WordPress makes adding videos easy with its built-in shortcode [video]. However, the built-in player is too limited with its features and not suitable for any advanced usage like playing live streams, showing advertisements, ability to share videos on social media websites, watermarking, etc. WP Video Enhanced provides the solution for these issues by simply extending the native [video] player. So, you no longer need to depend on any third-party player plugins, enjoy showing your video content using the built-in player as you like.
